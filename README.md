#Currency Converter

This project is a robust currency converter application developed using React and TypeScript. It provides the functionality to convert between various types of currencies, including fiat to fiat, fiat to crypto, and crypto to crypto conversions.

##Features

* **Currency Conversion:** Convert between various types of currencies including fiat to fiat, fiat to crypto, and crypto to crypto.

* **Real-time Rates:** The application fetches real-time currency rates from an API to provide the most accurate conversions.

* **User-friendly Interface:** The application provides a simple and intuitive interface for easy currency conversion.

* **Notes:** this aplication is designed to be used with the free version of the API, which has a limit of 300 requests per month. If you want to use it more frequently, you can sign up for a premium plan. I used the free version of the API for this project, due to thad I used a json file with the latest conversion rates. You can get your  API_KEY from: 

```http
https://currencyapi.com/
```

##Technologies Used

* **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

* **TypeScript:** A statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds types to the language.

* **Fetch API:** Used for making HTTP requests to fetch real-time currency rates.
